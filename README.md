## I. Common
### 1. Props
Most components can be customized when they are created, with different parameters. These creation parameters are called props.
Like attribute of compomnent on Android/IOS like color, text,...
### 2. State
There are two types of data that control a component: props and state. props are set by the parent and they are fixed throughout the lifetime of a component. For data that is going to change, we have to use state.
### 3. Style
All of the core components accept a prop named style. The style names and values usually match how CSS works on the web. As a component grows in complexity, it is often cleaner to use StyleSheet.create to define several styles in one place.
### 4. Height and Width
A component's height and width determine its size on the screen. Have two type: Fixed Dimensions and Flex Dimensions
### 5. Layout with Flexbox
A component can specify the layout of its children using the flexbox algorithm. Flexbox is designed to provide a consistent layout on different screen sizes.
